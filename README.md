This project demonstrates the essential statistics analyses currently used in Bioinformatics. 
These analyses are performed with the latest version of R-3.4.2 in RStudio-1.1.383 with 
Bioconductor (v3.6), and related R-packages & libraries.

R-packages and libraries needed to set up individual statistics analysis are summarized 
in “00 R-packages.R” file and also listed in the very beginning of each R-script file. 
Full R- scripts with step-by-step detailed comments/notes are provided. 
Real-world datasets, which worked with the R-scripts, are also enclosed.

This project covers all following statistics analyses:
